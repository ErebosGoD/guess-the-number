# HomePage Component Documentation

The `HomePage` component is a React component responsible for rendering the home page of the "Guess The Number" web application. This page is displayed to users when they are logged in and provides options to start a game or view high scores.

## Import Statements

```javascript
import { Box, Button, Typography } from "@mui/material";
import { GameStartApi } from "../apis/GameApi";
import { HighScoreApi } from "../apis/HighScoresApi";
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";
```

- The `import` statements include various modules and components required for building the home page. This includes Material-UI components, API modules, and React hooks.

## Functional Component Definition

```javascript
const HomePage = () => {
    // Component Logic
}
```

- `HomePage` is a functional component that defines the entire home page.

## State Variables

```javascript
const username = localStorage.getItem('username')
```

- The `username` variable retrieves the username from local storage to display a personalized welcome message.

## Helper Functions

```javascript
const handleGameStart = (e: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>) => {
    // Function Logic
};

const handleHighscores = (e: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>) => {
    // Function Logic
};
```

- These functions are used to handle user interactions and perform various tasks:
  - `handleGameStart`: Initiates the game start process by sending a request to the `GameStartApi` and navigating the user to the game page.
  - `handleHighscores`: Retrieves high scores using the `HighScoreApi`, stores the data in local storage, and navigates the user to the high scores page.

## Rendering

```javascript
return (
    <Box display='flex' flexDirection='column' justifyContent='center' alignItems='center'>
        {/* ... */}
        {/* JSX for rendering the home page */}
        {/* ... */}
    </Box>
);
```

- The `return` statement defines the JSX (user interface) for rendering the home page. It includes Material-UI components such as `Typography` and `Button` to create a user-friendly home page with a welcome message and options to start a game or view high scores.

## Component Export

```javascript
export default HomePage;
```

- This statement exports the `HomePage` component so that it can be imported and used in other parts of the application.

## Component Usage

To use the `HomePage` component, you can import it into your application and include it in your routing configuration to display it when the user is logged in and visits the home page.

```javascript
import HomePage from './HomePage';

// Inside your routing configuration...
<Route path="/home" element={<HomePage />} />
```
