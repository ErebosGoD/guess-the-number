# HighScorePage Component Documentation

The `HighScorePage` component is a React component responsible for rendering the high scores page of the "Guess The Number" web application. This page displays the highest scores achieved by users.

## Import Statements

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { DataGrid, GridColDef, GridRowsProp } from '@mui/x-data-grid';
import { Box, IconButton } from '@mui/material';
import RefreshIcon from '@mui/icons-material/Refresh';
```

- The `import` statements include various modules and components required for building the high scores page. This includes Material-UI components, icons, React hooks, and the `DataGrid` component from `@mui/x-data-grid`.

## Functional Component Definition

```javascript
const HighScorePage = () => {
    // Component Logic
}
```

- `HighScorePage` is a functional component that defines the entire high scores page.

## State Variables

```javascript
const [rows, setRows] = useState<GridRowsProp[]>([]);
```

- The component uses React `useState` hooks to manage the state variable `rows`, which stores the high score data to be displayed in the `DataGrid`.

## Helper Functions

```javascript
const highscoreStorageLoad = () => {
    // Function Logic
};

const getHighscores = (event: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>) => {
    // Function Logic
};
```

- These functions are used to handle data loading and user interactions:
  - `highscoreStorageLoad`: Loads high scores from local storage, formats them, sorts them by high score, and updates the `rows` state variable.
  - `getHighscores`: Triggers the high score data loading process when the user clicks the refresh button.

## Rendering

```javascript
return (
    <Box className="MuiBox-Center" display="flex" flexDirection="column" justifyContent="center" alignItems="center" sx={{ mt: "200px" }}>
        {/* ... */}
        {/* JSX for rendering the high scores page */}
        {/* ... */}
    </Box>
);
```

- The `return` statement defines the JSX (user interface) for rendering the high scores page. It includes Material-UI components such as `IconButton` and `DataGrid` to display the high score data and allow users to refresh it.

## DataGrid Configuration

- The `columns` variable defines the configuration of the columns in the `DataGrid`, including field names, headers, and rendering options.
- The `DataGrid` component is configured with rows and columns, pagination settings, and appearance styles.

## Component Export

```javascript
export default HighScorePage;
```

- This statement exports the `HighScorePage` component so that it can be imported and used in other parts of the application.

## Component Usage

To use the `HighScorePage` component, you can import it into your application and include it in your routing configuration to display it when the user wants to view high scores.

```javascript
import HighScorePage from './HighScorePage';

// Inside your routing configuration...
<Route path="/highscores" element={<HighScorePage />} />
```
