# `hashAlgorithm` Function Documentation

The `hashAlgorithm` function is responsible for hashing a given password string to generate a hash value. Hashing is a common technique used to securely store and compare passwords. This function takes a password as input and produces a hash value as output.

## Function Signature

```javascript
export function hashAlgorithm(password: string)
```

## Function Logic

The `hashAlgorithm` function follows these logic steps to hash a password:

1. It initializes the `hashedPW` variable with an arbitrary initial hash value (`1337` in this case).

2. The function iterates through each character of the `password` string using a `for` loop.

3. For each character, it calculates the character's Unicode code point using `password.charCodeAt(i)`.

4. It applies a bitwise XOR operation (`^`) between the current `hashedPW` value and the Unicode code point of the character. This step is a common practice in hash functions to introduce randomness and prevent collisions.

5. The `33` value is used as a magic number in the hash calculation, which is a common practice in hash functions to achieve better distribution of hash values.

6. After processing all characters in the password, the function ensures that the resulting `hashedPW` value is a positive integer by applying a bitwise right shift (`>>> 0`). This step guarantees that the hash value is non-negative.

7. Finally, the function returns the `hashedPassword` as a string representation of the hash value.

## Component Export

The `hashAlgorithm` function is exported and can be used throughout the application to hash passwords for various purposes, such as user authentication and password storage.

## Component Usage

To use the `hashAlgorithm` function, developers can import it and invoke it with the password they want to hash.

```javascript
import { hashAlgorithm } from './hashAlgorithm';

// Example usage:
const passwordToHash = 'mySecretPassword';
const hashedPassword = hashAlgorithm(passwordToHash);
```
