# `ErrorHandling` Component Documentation

The `ErrorHandling` component is responsible for rendering either the `Success` or `Error` component based on the provided `httpStatusCode`. It is designed to display appropriate feedback messages depending on the HTTP status code received from an API response.

## Component Props

The `ErrorHandling` component accepts the following props:

- **`httpStatusCode` (optional)**: This prop represents the HTTP status code received from an API response. If the HTTP status code is not provided (`undefined`), the component does not render any message. If a specific status code (e.g., 200 for success) is provided, the component renders the appropriate message.

## Component Logic

The `ErrorHandling` component follows these logic steps to render the appropriate message:

1. It checks whether the `httpStatusCode` prop is `undefined`. If it is, the component renders an empty `p` element, displaying no message.

2. If the `httpStatusCode` prop is not `undefined`, it further checks if the status code is equal to 200 (typically indicating success). If it is, the component renders the `Success` component to display a success message. Otherwise, it renders the `Error` component to display an error message.

## Component Export

The `ErrorHandling` component is exported and can be used in other parts of the application to provide visual feedback based on API responses or other operations.

## Component Usage

To use the `ErrorHandling` component, developers can include it in their application where they need to provide feedback to users based on the outcome of an operation, such as API requests.

```javascript
import { ErrorHandling } from './ErrorHandling';

// Example usage within a component:
const MyComponent = () => {
    // Perform an operation (e.g., an API request) and receive an HTTP status code.
    const httpStatusCode = 200; // Replace with the actual status code received.

    return (
        <div>
            {/* Other content */}
            <ErrorHandling httpStatusCode={httpStatusCode} />
        </div>
    );
};
```
