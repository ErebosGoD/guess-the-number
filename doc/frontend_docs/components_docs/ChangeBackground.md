# `changeBackgroundImage` Function Documentation

The `changeBackgroundImage` function is responsible for dynamically changing the background image of the web page based on the current URL or specific URL patterns. This function enhances the user experience by providing visually appealing backgrounds that correspond to different sections of the web application.

## Function Signature

```javascript
export function changeBackgroundImage(currentUrl: string)
```

## Function Logic

The `changeBackgroundImage` function follows these logic steps to set the background image based on the current URL:

1. It receives the `currentUrl` as a parameter, which represents the current URL of the web page.

2. The function checks the `currentUrl` for specific patterns related to different sections of the application, such as 'game', 'highscores', 'about', and 'u' (user-related).

3. Depending on the identified pattern, the function sets the background image of the `document.body` element accordingly. It uses different background images for different sections, enhancing the visual aesthetics of each section.

4. If the `currentUrl` doesn't match any of the predefined patterns, the function sets a default background image ('Background Day.png') to maintain a visually appealing background for the rest of the application.

5. The function also sets various background properties (`backgroundSize`, `backgroundRepeat`, `backgroundPosition`, and `backgroundAttachment`) to ensure the background image is displayed correctly.

## Component Export

The `changeBackgroundImage` function is exported and can be used throughout the application to dynamically set background images based on URL patterns.

## Component Usage

To use the `changeBackgroundImage` function, developers can import it and invoke it in their application, typically in a component that handles route changes or page initialization.

```javascript
import { changeBackgroundImage } from './backgroundUtils';

// Example usage in a React component (e.g., when handling route changes):
const MyComponent = () => {
    useEffect(() => {
        const currentUrl = window.location.pathname;
        changeBackgroundImage(currentUrl);
    }, []);

    // Rest of the component logic
};
```
