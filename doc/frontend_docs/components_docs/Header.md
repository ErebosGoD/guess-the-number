# `Header` Component Documentation

The `Header` component represents the application's header bar, which typically contains the logo, title, and navigation elements. It also includes dynamic behavior to adapt to different window sizes.

## Component Structure

The `Header` component is composed of the following elements:

1. **AppBar**: The top-level container representing the application's header. It uses the Material-UI `AppBar` component.

2. **Stack**: A layout container provided by Material-UI to organize its child elements.

3. **Toolbar**: A Material-UI component that serves as the container for the header's content. It can be customized to control its appearance and layout.

4. **Logo**: An image that serves as the logo for the application. It links to a GitHub page when clicked.

5. **Vertical Line**: A vertical line made using CSS, which separates the logo from the title.

6. **Title**: The title of the application, which can be either "GTN" (shortened) or "Guess The Number" based on the window width. It is a clickable link that redirects to the home page.

7. **AccountMenu**: A component that provides account-related actions such as account settings and logout.

8. **Window Width Management**: The component dynamically manages the window width to adjust the title text based on the available screen space.

## Component Logic

The `Header` component has the following key logic:

- It uses the `useState` hook to manage the `windowWidth` state, which stores the current width of the browser window.

- The `useEffect` hook is employed to set up an event listener for window resizing. When the window is resized, the `windowWidth` state is updated accordingly.

- The `vertLine` object defines the CSS properties for the vertical line between the logo and title.

- The title text (either "GTN" or "Guess The Number") is conditionally displayed based on the `windowWidth` state. If the window width is less than `700` pixels, the shortened "GTN" is displayed; otherwise, the full "Guess The Number" is shown.

## Component Export

The `Header` component is exported and can be included in the application's layout or other components where the header is needed.

## Component Usage

To use the `Header` component, developers can include it within the application's layout, typically at the top of the page, to provide a consistent header experience for users.

```javascript
import { Header } from './Header';

// Example usage within the main application component:
const App = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <Header />
            {/* Other application content */}
        </div>
    );
};
```
