# GameStartApi Function Documentation

The `GameStartApi` function is responsible for making an API request to the server's game start endpoint to initiate a new game session.

## Function Signature

```javascript
GameStartApi(session_id: string) => async function gameStart(event: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>)
```

- `session_id` (string): The session identifier associated with the user's current session.
- `event` (React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>): The click event that triggers the game start.

## Function Logic

1. Prevent the default behavior of the click event to avoid form submission.

2. Create a POST request to the server's game start endpoint using the `fetch` function.

3. Set the request headers to specify that the request body is in JSON format.

4. Create a request body JSON object with the following properties:
   - `kind`: Specifies the type of request as "game-start."
   - `session_id`: The session identifier associated with the user's current session.

5. Send the POST request to the server using the URL retrieved from the `getBackendUrl()` function.

## Component Export

The `GameStartApi` function is exported for use in other parts of the application, allowing developers to initiate game start requests.

## Component Usage

To use the `GameStartApi` and `GameApi` functions, you can import them into your application and call them when handling game start and game guess interactions, typically triggered by clicking buttons in the game interface.
