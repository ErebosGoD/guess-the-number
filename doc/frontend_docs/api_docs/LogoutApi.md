# LogoutApi Function Documentation

The `LogoutApi` function is responsible for making an API request to the server's logout endpoint to log out the current user session.

## Function Signature

```javascript
LogoutApi(session_id: string) => async function logout(event: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>)
```

- `session_id` (string): The session identifier associated with the user's current session.
- `event` (React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>): The click event that triggers the logout.

## Function Logic

1. Prevent the default behavior of the click event to avoid form submission.

2. Create a POST request to the server's logout endpoint using the `fetch` function.

3. Set the request headers to specify that the request body is in JSON format.

4. Create a request body JSON object with the following properties:
   - `kind`: Specifies the type of request as "logout."
   - `session_id`: The session identifier associated with the user's current session.

5. Send the POST request to the server using the URL retrieved from the `getBackendUrl()` function.

## Component Export

The `LogoutApi` function is exported for use in other parts of the application, allowing developers to initiate user logout requests by providing the necessary input parameters.

## Component Usage

To use the `LogoutApi` function, you can import it into your application and call it when handling user logout interactions, typically triggered by clicking a logout button.

```javascript
import { LogoutApi } from './LogoutApi';

// Example usage in a React component:
const handleLogoutClick = (event) => {
    LogoutApi(sessionId)(event)
        .then(() => {
            // Handle the successful logout, e.g., clear user session data or navigate to the login page.
        })
        .catch((error) => {
            // Handle logout error, e.g., display an error message.
        });
};
```
